# Understanding Virtual Networking on AWS

- For Networking in AWS we use Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- VPC is a logically isolated network in the AWS cloud
- It is the main network within we can have our subnets for EC2, RDS instances and every other thing which requires network.
- It gives control of the network architecture
- It has enhanced security. Within this VPC we can configure security groups through which we can control the Ingress and Egress
- Through VPC we can interconnect with other organizations which is called VPC Peering
- Through VPC we can assign Elastic/Public IP to our instances
- We can enable hybrid cloud (site-to-site VPN)
