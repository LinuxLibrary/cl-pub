# IAM Roles

We know that for accessing the any service in AWS the user need permission. But if any AWS service should access another AWS service then we need to create roles and then need to attach policies to that roles based on the requirement.

- Create a role from the IAM Dashboard
- Select the AWS Service role
- Attach the policy required
