# IAM Groups and Policies

We have created some users and attached policies to those users. Primarily we have provided FullAccess to those users. In such case we can create a group and have those users added to this group and can attach a policy at the group level.

- Go to the users and dettach the policies assigned earlier
- Create a group
- Add the users to this group
- Attach "AmazonS3FullAccess" policy to this group

> Besides attaching policies for individual users it is a best practice to manage the users within a group
