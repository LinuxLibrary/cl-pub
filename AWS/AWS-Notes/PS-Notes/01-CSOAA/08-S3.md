# Working with Amazon S3

- S3 Characteristics
	- Its not a filesystem
	- AWS Region-level storage
	- Supports REST and SOAP APIs
	- Bucket names should be globally unique
	- Server-side encryption of data at rest
- There are 2 types of S3 Storages
	- Standard storage
		- 99.999999999% durability
		- 99.99% availability
	- Reduced Reduncy Storage (RRS)
		- 99.99% durability (average annual expected loss of 0.01% objects)
		- 99.99% availability
- S3 Replication
	- S3 stores data in multiple facilities on multiple devices within each facility
	- RRS Amazon S3 does not replicate objects as many times as standard Amazon S3
	- Synchronously stores data accross multiple facilities before confirming that the data has been successfully stored
	- Calculates checksums on all network traffic to detect corruption of data packets
- S3 Features
	- Versioning
	- Cross Region Replication (CRR)
	- MFA delete (via API)
	- Time limited access to objects
	- Audit logs
	- Event Notifications
	- Data lifecycle management
	- Permissions
- S3 Securities
	- IAM Policies
		- User level security
		- Granular security configuration
		- These can be used when we need the S3 objects to be used within AWS
	- Bucket Policies
		- Bucket level security
		- These can be useful while the S3 objects need to be used outside of AWS
	- ACLs
		- Legecy access control mechanism
		- Bucket and Object level security
	- Query string authentication (Presigned URLs)
		- Grant temporary access to your Amazon S3 resources
