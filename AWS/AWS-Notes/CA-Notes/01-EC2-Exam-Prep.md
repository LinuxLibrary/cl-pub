# EC2 Exam Preperation

* AMIs and Instance Types:
    - AMIs are digital templates of pre-configured EC2 Instances allowing you to quickly launch a new instance
    - You have the choice of AWS Managed, custom, market place and community AMIs

* Instance Types:
    - Instance types are defined ny different parameters and their values such as amount of memory, network performance, storage etc.
    - As your instance size gets bigger, the parameter values (vCPU, network performance, storage) also increases
    - Some instances only support EBS and do not support for ephermal storage
    - General purpose instances gives a good balance of compute, memory and network resources, so its great for lots of different use cases
    - Compute optimized instances are designed for compute intensive workloads requiring high performance processors
    - Memory optimized instances help you deliver super fast performance for processing data sets in memory
    - Accelerated computing instance types use hardware accelerators which are great for graphics and data pattern matching
    - Storage optimzed instances maintain low latency IOPS and sequential read and write access to massive data sets locally
